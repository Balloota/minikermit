Minikermit i a linux terminal program especially for communication with microcontroller development boards.<br>
*How it works* <br>
Connect the development board over a serial communication line with your pc and start minikermit in your shell. Minikermit then waits for key pressed at pc keypad and sends character over serial line to the development board. Characters, which the development board sends over serial line, are displayed in the minikermit terminal window.<br>
minikermit terminated, if you press 'q' or 'Q' at keypad. If you press 'w', minikermit
alters to upload-state (upload binary data in microcontroller board). This is the NONECHOMODE of minikermit (default after startup). The microcontroller can toogle to ECHOMODE by serial sending the TOGGLEECHOMODE-char (0x03).minikermit in ECHOMODE terminates only with CTRL-C sequence from shell.
When the microcontroller sends SUPRESSSERINPUT	(0x04), the pc blocks the output of chars from serial in the terminal window, if it sends ACCEPTSERINPUT (0x05), the chars from serial are written in the pc terminal window (default at startup).
