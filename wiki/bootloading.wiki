#summary how upload binary programs with minikermit
If you type 'w' int the minikermit terminal, you can upload binary data at the microcontroller board with an compatible bootloader .<br>
Minikermit asks for a file name and opens the file for upload.<br>
We use 2 protocols for upload binary programs or data currently, the protocol of bamo128 (own hastily cobbled together protocol) and the protocol of arduino bootloader (stk500v1 compatible).<br>
The arduino version of minikermit [MiniKermitAndArduino] use the arduino compatible protocol only..
