#summary version of minikermit optimized for arduino boards

*Compiling*<br>
Download and unpack to arduinokermit.c and open a shell. 
Arduinokermit is presetted for:<br>
#define BAUDRATE  B57600<br>
#define MODEMDEVICE 	"/dev/ttyUSB0"<br>
#define SCANSERIALDEVICES	// test for /dev/ttyUSB0,1,2,..9 or ACM0,1,2,..9<br>

For USB/ACM ports sometimes you have awhile "skeletons in the closet" if you reset your microcontroller board or temporary disconnect the board. Therefore arduinokermit tests successive for USB0, USB1,.... USB9 for a "living" connection port. Remove this code (comment prpeprocessor directive above), if you not need this behavior.

Arduinokermit use the stk500V1 protocol for uploading like the arduinoIDE only.

Now compile it:<br>
#> g++ arduinokermit.c -lncurses -oarduinokermit<br>
compiles arduinokermit.c and produces the executable file arduinokermit. Be sure, you have installed the GNU c-development tools (g++) and the ncurses-library before.<br>
Connect your pc with the serial cable with your development board and start ardinokermit from the command line:<br>
#>./minikermit<br>
You can communicate now with your development board according to the monitor program.<br>
