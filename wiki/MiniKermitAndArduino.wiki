Arduino boards are equipped with a minimal monitor program. There are diverse variants of arduino boards (and bootloaders) and I am not a specialist for this topic (correct me, if somewhat is wrong here).<br>
I'm only writing about the boards arduino duemilanove and arduinoMega.
I think, the explanations can be applied to other boards also.<br>
